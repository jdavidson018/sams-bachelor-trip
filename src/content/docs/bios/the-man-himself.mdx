### Bio

There comes a moment in every man's life where things change forever. A canon moment if you will.
For some, it is the birth of a child. For others, it is the day they get married. For Sam, 
it is a two way tie between the day he discovered alcohol and the day some girl said his 
butt look good in a Winnie the Pooh costume.

The only Davidson brother that's a real doctor, and the man of the hour, Sam is truly someone worth
celebrating. He is not only the reason for this trip New Orleans, he is also the driving force behind everyone elses blackouts. 
Truly this man has a gift for making people forget their own names.
