# Lodging Details

## Address

**424 Gravier Street, New Orleans, LA 70130**

## Check-in

Check-in is on Thursday after 4:00 PM.
  * It is an auto check-in with a Smart lock, so I will see about getting an early check-in. If you are arriving early, maybe have a backup bar to wait it out at, just in case.

## Check-Out

Checkout is Sunday before 11:00 AM.

## Size

Max capacity is 21 guests. We will have between 15 and 18 people, so it should be roomy.

<Callout type="info">
The beds are primarily kings and queens, so plan on sharing with one other person. Individual beds may be awarded for supreme acts of bravery or valor.
